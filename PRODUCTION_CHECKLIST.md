# Production Deployment Checklist

## Critical Issues Fixed ✅

### Security Issues
- ✅ **Fixed Admin API Authentication**: Added proper JWT token verification to admin endpoints
- ✅ **Added Authorization Checks**: All admin APIs now verify user is admin/support
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Added validation for all required fields in APIs
- ✅ **User Ownership Verification**: APIs verify resources belong to requesting user

### Performance & Production Issues
- ✅ **Replaced In-Memory Storage**: Fixed WebSocket and notification APIs to use Firebase instead of in-memory storage
- ✅ **Fixed Team Member Queries**: Corrected inconsistent member handling in Teams API
- ✅ **Added Error Handling**: Improved error responses for authentication failures
- ✅ **React Hooks Warning**: Fixed useWebSocket hook ref cleanup issue

### Code Quality
- ✅ **ESLint Warnings**: Resolved all React hooks exhaustive-deps warnings
- ✅ **Function Name Collisions**: Fixed updateTask naming conflict in store
- ✅ **Added Input Validation**: Enhanced validation across API endpoints
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Improved error handling and null checks

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Set all required environment variables in production
- [ ] Test Firebase connection with production credentials
- [ ] Verify Google/GitHub OAuth configuration
- [ ] Test admin account email verification bypass

### Security Verification
- [ ] Verify admin APIs require authentication tokens
- [ ] Test unauthorized access returns proper 401/403 responses
- [ ] Confirm user data isolation (users can only access their own data)
- [ ] Test rate limiting on API endpoints (if implemented)

### Database Indexes (Firestore)
- [ ] Create indexes for notifications queries:
  - `notifications` collection: `userId`, `status`, `createdAt` (composite)
- [ ] Create indexes for teams queries:
  - `teams` collection: `members.{userId}`, `leaderId`
- [ ] Create indexes for presence queries:
  - `presence` collection: `teams` (array-contains)

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Test application load times
- [ ] Verify image optimization is working
- [ ] Test with realistic data volumes
- [ ] Monitor Firebase quota usage

### Feature Testing
- [ ] User authentication (email, Google, GitHub)
- [ ] Email verification flow
- [ ] Admin panel access (with admin credentials)
- [ ] Task CRUD operations
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Notification system
- [ ] Real-time presence tracking

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Set up Firebase monitoring
- [ ] Configure error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Monitor Firebase costs/quotas

## Deployment Steps

1. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Copy values from .env.local to production platform
   # For Vercel: Settings > Environment Variables
   ```

2. **Build Verification**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Should complete without errors
   ```

3. **Deploy to Platform**
   ```bash
   # Vercel
   vercel --prod
   
   # Or push to main branch if auto-deploy is configured
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - [ ] Visit production URL
   - [ ] Test login flow
   - [ ] Create and manage tasks
   - [ ] Test admin features
   - [ ] Verify real-time features work

## Production Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Firebase Firestore read/write operations
- Authentication success/failure rates
- API response times
- Error rates by endpoint
- User engagement metrics

### Firebase Console Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor Firestore usage
- [ ] Check authentication logs
- [ ] Review security rules performance
- [ ] Monitor storage usage

### Alert Setup
- [ ] High error rates
- [ ] Firebase quota approaching limits
- [ ] Authentication failures spike
- [ ] API response time degradation

## Backup & Recovery

### Data Backup
- [ ] Set up automated Firestore backups
- [ ] Test backup restore procedures
- [ ] Document recovery processes

### Disaster Recovery
- [ ] Document rollback procedures
- [ ] Test deployment rollback
- [ ] Verify backup data integrity

## Performance Optimizations Applied

1. **Next.js Image Optimization**: Fixed `<img>` tags to use Next.js `<Image>` component
2. **Firebase Connection Pooling**: Using singleton pattern for Firebase admin
3. **Efficient Firestore Queries**: Added proper indexes and query optimization
4. **Memory Management**: Fixed in-memory storage issues in production APIs

## Known Limitations

1. **WebSocket Fallback**: Current implementation uses REST API polling instead of true WebSocket for real-time features
2. **Notification System**: Uses Firebase REST API instead of push notifications
3. **File Upload**: Limited to Cloudinary configuration (may need scaling)

## Future Improvements

1. Implement true WebSocket server for real-time features
2. Add push notification service
3. Implement API rate limiting
4. Add comprehensive logging system
5. Implement data analytics dashboard

## Emergency Contacts

- **Firebase Admin**: [admin-email]
- **Deployment Platform**: [platform-contact]
- **Domain/DNS**: [dns-provider-contact]
- **SSL Certificate**: [ssl-provider-contact]

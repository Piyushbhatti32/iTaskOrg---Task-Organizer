# ðŸ”§ Fixes Applied - iTaskOrg Issues Resolution

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… **Admin Help Desk Visibility Issue**
**Problem:** Normal users were able to see and access the admin help desk.

**Root Cause:** The `ALLOW_ALL_ADMINS` flag was set to `true` in `src/utils/roles.js`, which made all logged-in users appear as admins during development.

**Solution Applied:**
- Set `ALLOW_ALL_ADMINS = false` in `src/utils/roles.js`
- Added warning messages to prevent this issue in production
- Now only users with emails in the `ADMIN_USERS` array can access admin features:
  - `itaskorg@gmail.com`
  - `itaskorg+admin@gmail.com` 
  - `itaskorg+support@gmail.com`
  - `piyushbhatti32@gmail.com`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/roles.js`

### 2. âœ… **Login Persistence Issue**
**Problem:** Users were getting logged out after every session, even when they didn't want to.

**Root Cause:** 
- Cookie expiration was too short (1 hour default)
- Firebase persistence was set to session-only for non-remember logins

**Solution Applied:**
- Increased default cookie duration from 1 hour to 24 hours
- For "Remember Me" option: extended to 30 days (was 7 days)
- Changed Firebase persistence to use `browserLocalPersistence` by default instead of `browserSessionPersistence`
- This ensures users stay logged in across browser sessions unless they explicitly logout

**Files Modified:**
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`

### 3. âœ… **Additional Security Improvements**
**Improvements Made:**
- Added middleware protection for admin routes (`/admin/*`)
- Non-admin users attempting to access admin routes are now redirected to `/help-desk`
- Updated middleware matcher to include admin and help-desk routes
- Enhanced admin email validation in middleware

**Files Modified:**
- `src/middleware.ts`

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Admin Access Control:
1. Login with a non-admin account
2. Try to navigate to `/admin/help-desk`
3. You should be redirected to `/help-desk` instead
4. Check that the admin section in the navigation menu is hidden for non-admin users

### Test Login Persistence:
1. Login to the application (without checking "Remember Me")
2. Close the browser completely
3. Reopen the browser and navigate to the app
4. You should remain logged in for up to 24 hours
5. With "Remember Me" checked, you should stay logged in for up to 30 days

## Configuration Notes

### For Production Deployment:
- Ensure `ALLOW_ALL_ADMINS` remains `false` in `src/utils/roles.js`
- Add your production admin emails to the `ADMIN_USERS` array
- Consider moving admin emails to environment variables for better security

### Admin Users Currently Configured:
- `itaskorg@gmail.com`
- `itaskorg+admin@gmail.com`
- `itaskorg+support@gmail.com`
- `piyushbhatti32@gmail.com`

## Summary
Both critical issues have been resolved:
- âœ… Admin help desk is now properly restricted to admin users only
- âœ… Login persistence has been improved with longer session durations
- âœ… Additional security measures have been implemented

Users should now have a much better experience with persistent logins and proper access control.
